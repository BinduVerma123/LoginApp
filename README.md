# LoginApp
This is a Simple Login App app made in Java using Android Studio.


First when u get this app uninstalled immediately there will open a Splash screen.A splash screen is a first screen which we see after installing any app it will lasts only for a few seconds then after this u cannot see this screen.


Then after the Splash screen disappears the login page will open.This Login page will give a limited number of chances(e.g-5) to enter the correct username and password.


If u did not get the the username and password correct within the 5 times of inputting then after entering for the sixth time the Login Button will get disabled and u cannot enter to the second activity.
